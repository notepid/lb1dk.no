Architecting software systems for the sports industry by day, ham radio operator by night.

Focusing on SOTA (Summits on the Air) when the weather allows it, but when stuck indoors it is mostly digital modes like FT8 that keeps me busy.

Hobbies are my hobby but to mention a few:

- 3D printing
- Electronics
- Remotecontrolled gadgets
- Software defined radio
- Board games and gaming in general

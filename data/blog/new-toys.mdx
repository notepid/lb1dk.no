summary: My Xiegu G90 have served me well, but I longed for more so now I am the proud owner of a Yaesy FT-710 and a Yaesu FT-891
---

Don't get me wrong—I really enjoy the Xiegu G90, and I'm definitely not planning to part ways with it. However, my HAM shack recently welcomed two new members of the Yaesu lineage: the FT-710 and the FT-891.

## Why the FT-710? ##
The primary reason for adding the FT-710 to my lineup was convenience. I got tired of constantly disconnecting and reconnecting the G90 every time I wanted to head out the door. I wanted something more permanent, with a bit more power under the hood.

After countless hours on YouTube and poring over reviews, my final contenders were the Icom 7300, the Yaesu FT-710, and the Yaesu FTDX10. I nearly scored a used FTDX10 for an amazing price, but it was snatched up literally before my eyes. Not long after, I stumbled upon a used FT-710, and moments later, it was on its way to my mailbox.

I've been using it for almost a month now, and I couldn't be happier. It does everything I need and so much more—I'm still learning about its full potential. The advanced filters on this rig are game-changers and would have been incredibly handy during the recent CQ Worldwide Contest. Now, I'm practicing with the various filters and noise suppression features to be ready for the next one.

Unfortunately, winter isn't doing me any favors. The 20m band is mostly closed in the evenings, which is the only time I can operate—and the only band I currently have an antenna for at my QTH. Living up north means daylight disappears around 14:30, leaving me with very little time for radio. Spring can't come soon enough!

I do have a project in the works to build a [spiral loop antenna](https://www.nonstopsystems.com/radio/frank_radio_antenna_SM0VPO.htm) for 40m. So far, my attempts at creating a variable capacitor have been unsuccessful, but I'm not giving up. I'll definitely write about it here—whether I succeed or fail.

## Why the FT-891? ##
So, why did I get the FT-891 when I already have a G90? Well, to be honest, I placed a bid on a used FT-891 and promptly forgot about it. A few days later, I discovered I had won the auction! No complaints, though—it was a happy accident.

A 100W portable rig is something I've been eyeing for a while, especially for POTA/SOTA activations. As frequent readers of this blog might know, I've been using a power amplifier (PA) with the G90 to boost my signal. While that setup worked okay, it had its quirks. For example, I noticed some unpleasant clicks in the radio when I released the PTT, which led me to suspect some reflected power from the PA back into the G90.

Additionally, the PA required heavier batteries, as it couldn't handle the 4S LiPo battery I normally use for portable operations. Lugging those extra batteries made my backpack heavier than I liked. Now, with the FT-891's 100W capability and compatibility with my 4S LiPo battery (and eventually the LiFePO4 I have on order), I've streamlined my setup and lightened my load.

## Bonus: Mobile Activations ##
In other news, I've managed to get an Ampro 40m whip working on the roof of my car. This has allowed me to do some POTA activations right from the comfort of my vehicle. It's been a game-changer for cold-weather operations!

I'm excited to explore these new radios and refine my portable setups over the coming months.

Happy DXing!

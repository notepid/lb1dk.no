I've decided to start a blog to document my exploration and learning around being a ham radio operator.

There are many reasons for this, but the main one is that I want to have a central place to collect my thoughts and ideas around the subject. I've been learning a lot, and I want to have a place to collect and share my knowledge.

I just got my license this summer, and I've already learned a lot from people on youtube, local people in my local club, and online communities. I've also been experimenting a lot with antennas and how to use my previous experience with 3D design and 3D printing to see how these two hobbies can be combined.

This blog is the first step in my journey to share my knowledge and experiences with others. I also hope that it will be a resource for others who are interested in learning about ham radio.

I'm still trying to figure out how I want to use the blog, but I'm thinking that it will be a combination of a journal, a documentation of my learning, and a collection of resources. For sure it will be a way of documenting my SOTA activations, but I also want to write about other things that I find interesting.

I'm excited for what the future holds, and I'm looking forward to sharing my journey with you.

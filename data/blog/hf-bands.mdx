summary: One of the things as a new HAM struggle with is to remember what the different HF bands are good for and when to use them. So here is my compliation of this information and I hope it is useful to you as well.

Note that all frequency bands are not the same everywhere so these are the bands that I am allowed to use in Norway (IARU Region 1). Depending on where you are located there might be different freuency ranges and bands available to you, so make sure you check that before you start transmitting.

| Popular name      | Frequency range (MHz) | Notes              | Day band  	| Night band  	| Contests allowed  	|
|---	            |---	                |---	        |---	        |---	        |---	                |
| 160m 	            | 1.810 - 2.000         |   	        |   	        |   	        |   	                |
| 80m  	            | 3.500 - 3.800 	    | Best suited for short range and local contacts. More range during nights.|   	        |   	        |   	                |
| 60m  	            | 5.3515 - 5.3665 	    |   	        |     	        |      	        |   	                |
| 40m  	            | 7.000 - 7.200 	    | Good range during the day, and world wide during night. More resillient to sunspots than 20m. | Local         | X     	        |   	                |
| 30m  	            | 10.100 - 10.150  	    | Similar to 40m but only for CW and digital modes.  	        |     	        |      	        |   	                |
| 20m  	            | 14.000 - 14.350  	    | This is my home where everything just works. Can be used both day and night for voice and digital. Can have world wide QSOs if conditions are just right even on 20W.  	        | X    	        | X     	        | X  	                |
